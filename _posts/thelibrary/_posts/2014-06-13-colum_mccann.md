Through the Lens is proud to present Colum McCann, a critically acclaimed Irish born writer who lives and works in New York City.
He is the 2009 winner of the prestigious National Book Award. His latest book, Transatlantic, has been universally praised for his vision and the audacity of his writing. In person, Colum is everything a diva is not. He is extremely polite, cooperative and articulate with a refreshing, self-deprecating sense of humor.
