Darien Library is offering iPads loaded with apps and programs designed to allow users the opportunity to explore the relationship between art and technology. Users may use a drawing/sketching program, take an art quiz, or listen to podcasts from the MoMA Conversations series. Art iPads are available to Darien residents, those who work in Darien full-time, and Friends who have donated $300 or more. Patrons must be 18 years or older to complete the checkout process.
