On Monday, September 24, Mark Albertson presented the second lecture in his Roadblocks to Republic series.

America’s founding as a Republic was not without its impediments; so inspired as they were from the ranks of the Revolutionary Generation themselves. Join us for this four-week series as we discuss.

Week Two: Alien and Sedition Acts, 1798
Concern by the Federalists was two-fold: The number of alien Frenchmen favorable to Jeffersonian Republicans, and the journalistic opposition to Federalist policies. The Alien and Sedition Acts lent credence to George Washington’s concern of party affiliation causing factionalism, of a type which could have irreparably rent the fledgling Republic.
