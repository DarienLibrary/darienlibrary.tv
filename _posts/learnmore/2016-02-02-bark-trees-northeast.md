On Tuesday, February, 2, 2016, Darien Library cosponsored this event with the Tree Conservancy of Darien, the Darien Land Trust and the Darien Nature Center.

Do you want to know more about the trees in your local woods? The traits most often used to describe tree species—leaves, buds, and twigs—are high and out of sight on most trees or, in the case of leaves, absent for half the year. Join naturalist Michael Wojtech for an exploration of bark, the tree characteristic that is always visible, in every season. In addition to learning about species identification, you will also begin to discover why such a variety of bark characteristics exist. Why do some species have smooth bark, while on others it is thick and broken? Why do layers of bark peel away in curly strips?

About the Presenter
Michael Wojtech spent his childhood roaming the pine barrens of southern New Jersey. After a 15 year career in business he decided to pursue his love of natural history and writing. He earned his Master’s Degree in Conservation Biology from Antioch University New England, where he edited the journal Whole Terrain. His thesis at Antioch on tree bark became the basis for his book, Bark: A Field Guide to Trees of the Northeast. Michael is a freelance writer, educator, illustrator, and photographer. His main focus is trees, but he encounters many other aspects of natural history that he can’t help but dive into. He lives tucked into the woods of western Massachusetts.

Michael will be available to sign copies of his book, Bark: A Field Guide to Trees of the Northeast. For more details visit: www.knowyourtrees.com.
