On Monday, December 12, 2016, Mark Albertson joined us for week three of his Cold War lecture series. 

The jockeying for position of primacy between Washington and Moscow sometimes resembled a high stakes game of chicken. But behind the idea of Détente was the military card; in particular, the nuclear option. This talk will trace attempts at nuclear disarmament, such as SALT I--the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks I; SALT II; the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty or START I; the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. These will be explored against the background for potential use: Operation Vulture, 1954; the Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962; the Arab-Israeli War, 1973.
