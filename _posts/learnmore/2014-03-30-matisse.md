On Sunday, March 30, 2014, Larissa Bailiff joined us from MoMA to discuss 20th-century master Henri Matisse. Explore the intertwined life and work of the French artist who repeatedly shaped modernism's trajectory through his on-going fifty-year dance with color, flatness, and form. The talk will include a special preview of the upcoming Fall exhibition: Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs.
