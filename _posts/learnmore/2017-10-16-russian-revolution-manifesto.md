On Monday, October 16, 2017, Mark Albertson shared the first lecture in his four week series on The Russian Revolution. 

This four-week series traces one of the defining events of the 20th century: The Russian Revolution. The journey will begin with an explanation of Marx’s and Engel’s Communist Manifesto, culminating with Stalin’s rise to power. The collapse of the Romanovs will be showcased followed by the rise of the Bolsheviks. Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin and others will be profiled. Central to this four-week sojourn into history will be the irrevocable changes sweeping across Europe following the French Revolution; focusing, of course, on the collapse of Czarist Russia and the advent of Bolshevik Russia; hence, the Soviet Union.

Week 1: The Manifesto

In 1848, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels produced a work that would eventually generate a political challenge of the most explosive variety. This session will analyze this impactful book, the doctrine and the practitioners who brought the Manifest to life.
