On Wednesday, August 9, 2017, Gil Harel presented his fourth and final lecture in his classical music series. 

As the 20th century approached, artists in various disciplines began to embrace elements which marked a significant departure from previous styles. Born in 1860, Gustav Mahler worked within familiar genres, but imbued these works with unique traits that make them unambiguously his. In other parts of Europe, composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg would take the music of the 20th century in a decidedly different direction.
