On Wednesday, February 7, 2018, we were joined by Gil Harel, PhD for the third lecture in his Mozart series.

Freeing himself from dead-end employment in Salzburg, Mozart's arrival in Vienna was marked by many consecutive successes. Perhaps most cherished among these are the operatic masterpieces of the late 1780s, including Don Giovanni, Die Zauberfloete, and others. During this program we will consider why Mozart succeeded so stupendously in an idiom where others (including Beethoven and Haydn) fell short of the mark.
