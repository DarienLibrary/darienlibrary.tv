"Eleanor Roosevelt was not only the First Lady of America, but of the world," so said Harry Truman. Join us for this special lecture on a lady of the most dynamic variety who stands as a beacon for those seeking to rise to occasion in the face of adversity to make their mark. The quintessential American liberal who personified those seeking to improve the lot of their fellow Man, Eleanor was a trailblazer who showed women over the world the potential inherent in their gender, that of being able to change the world and make it a better place.
