On Monday, April 3, 2017, we hosted a lecture to commemorate the 100th anniversary of America's entry into the First World War.

Decisive Day: April 6, 1917. A day of greater significance than December 7, 1941 or September 11, 2001. For on this day, Congress codified the fact that America was a Global Power. The Grand Republic would be changed forever as it took its place on the world stage, irrevocably altering the global balance of power. By 1917, a changing of the guard was apparent: The decline of the British and French colonial empires, with the resulting void filled by Pax Americana; an evolution that would see to the demise of the Republic and the rise of the American Corporate State.
