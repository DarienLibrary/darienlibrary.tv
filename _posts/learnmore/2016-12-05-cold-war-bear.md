On Monday, December 5, 2016, we were joined again by Mark Albertson for the second lecture in his Cold War series. 

Today's lecture surrounds The Cold War from the perspective of the Motherland. Starting with Stalin's program of Forced Industrialization in 1928, the rise to power of the Soviet Union from a backward peasant economy to the world's second leading industrial power will be traced. The presentation will then progress through the 1950s to the collapse of 1990-91.
