On Wednesday, January 31, 2018, Gil Harel presented the second lecture on Mozart. 

Despite a celebrated childhood, Mozart's transition into life as an independent adult was marked by difficulties finding employment and fulfillment in his love life. During this program we will consider works that include symphonies, concerti, and chamber music that date from a tumultuous period of uncertainty.
