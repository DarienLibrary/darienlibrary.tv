On Thursday, June 8, 2017, Mark Albertson presented lecture one in his new series. 

Most attempts to chronicle the Third Reich seem wedded to the period of 1933-1945. A broader perspective for understanding Hitler’s Germany is hardly possible unless one engages in the formative years of the Nazi Movement, 1919-1934. From the demise of Imperial Germany to the Night of the Long Knives, this course will chronicle the Nazi Revolution.

Week 1: The Stab in the Back

We begin our series with Armistice Day, followed by the descent of the German State into chaos. Our lecture continues with the aftermath of the Kiel Mutiny, “Bloody Week” in Berlin, the Diktat, Weimar Constitution, origins of the Nazi Party, and the Treaty of Rapallo, 1922.
