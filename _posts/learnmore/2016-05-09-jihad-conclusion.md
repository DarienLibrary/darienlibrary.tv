On Monday, May 9, 2016, we were joined by Mark Albertson for part four of this four week class on one of the globe's most fascinating and misunderstood religions.

The evolving Pan-Islamic movement takes the fight to Western interests in the Near East, spurred on by the American invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Western actions against Libya, the civil war in Syria all contribute to weakening ties and the rise of the Islamic State.
