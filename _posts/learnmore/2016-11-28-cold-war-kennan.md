On Monday, November 28, 2016, Mark Albertson began his Cold War lecture series. 

Our series begins with discussion of the doctrine of the renowned American foreign policy specialist, George Kennan. Based on the Mr. X article he published in Foreign Affairs in 1947, Containment was the strategy by which America would face the Soviet challenge whenever and wherever it posed a threat. Kennan considered the Soviet threat primarily political; and, saw such tools as America's economic advantage and "psychological warfare" as the proper strategy for reining in the Soviet Bear. Of course, for this strategy to be successful Americans would not be able to withdraw into that self-imposed incarceration known as Isolationism, as in 1865 and 1919.
