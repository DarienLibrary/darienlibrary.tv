On Thursday, October 12, 2017, author Joseph A. Williams joined us to discuss his book, "The Sunken Gold." 

Senior Moments, a monthly coffee and conversation group, will meet in the Community Room.

“A well-told tale of naval exploits in which gold is the MacGuffin.” —Kirkus Reviews
The Sunken Gold: A story of World War I, espionage, and the greatest treasure salvage in history is the story of how a British ship, HMS "Laurentic," laden with forty-four tons of Allied gold bound for the United States, is sunk off the coast of Ireland by Germany and the epic struggle by divers from the British Navy to recover the treasure. The book also describes the underwater spywork conducted by the divers by breaking into sunken U-boats looking for codes, ciphers, and other secret documents. There are still 20 bars of gold in the wreck waiting to be discovered. Meet author Joseph A. Williams during this event.
