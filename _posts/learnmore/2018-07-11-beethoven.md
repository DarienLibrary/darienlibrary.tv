On Wednesday, July 11, 2018, Gil Harel kicked off the first lecture in his new Beethoven series. 

Week 1: Beethoven in the Twilight of the Enlightenment
Ludwig van Beethoven was not yet 6 years old when the Declaration of Independence was signed. This perhaps serves to remind us that the young composer grew up in an era very much dominated by Enlightenment thoughts and philosophies. And yet, by the time he moved to Vienna to pursue his destiny in the great "City of Musicians", society was changing rapidly. During this program, we will discuss Beethoven's childhood and adolescence, comparing him - as is so often the case - to W. A. Mozart. Our repertoire discussion will cover works which reflect the logical and rational aspects of the late 18th century, as well as works which foreshadow the deeply personal and passionate attributes evinced by art of the coming era.
