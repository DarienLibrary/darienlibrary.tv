Despite being one of the Nation's smaller states, Connecticut played an extraordinarily large role in the American War for Independence. Connecticut government, people, and industry helped pave the way to a remarkable victory against the superpower of the 18th Century. But it was not without cost, as Connecticut was repeatedly invaded by British forces during the war. This presentation reviews the importance of Connecticut and those whose actions proved significant during the eight years of conflict.

So, grab your cocked hat and buckled shoes, your quill pen and paper for a visit to Connecticutâ€™s Revolutionary past.
