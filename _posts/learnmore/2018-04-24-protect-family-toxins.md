On Tuesday, April 24, 2018, we heard from Rhonda Sherwood and Sarah Evans on how to protect your family from toxins. 

Everyone likes a lush, green lawn and a bug free home, but what are the health consequences of even low level pesticide exposure? Join Dr. Sarah Evans, an instructor at the Mount Sinai Children’s Environmental Health Center in New York, and Rhonda Sherwood, founding vice chairman of the Mount Sinai Children’s Environmental Health Center Executive Board, as they present a lively discussion on pesticides and your family’s health. Topics include:

* What are the health risks of pesticide exposure?
* Is it safe to use just a little bit of pesticides on your lawn?
* How do I treat an ant infestation/hornet’s nest/termite problem safely?
* What’s the scientific consensus on Round Up, the most popular herbicide in the world?

Darien Library is proud to cosponsor this event with the Darien Nature Center.
