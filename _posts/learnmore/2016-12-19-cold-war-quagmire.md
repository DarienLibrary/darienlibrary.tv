On Monday, December 19, 2016, Mark Albertson concluded his four week lecture series on the Cold War.

How the Soviet sojourn into Afghanistan in 1979 helped to bring down the Soviet Union; and, helped to transform the Cold War. With the Soviet collapse, America was left as the world's sole Superpower. Afghanistan, though, unleashed militant Islamic Fundamentalism, helping to transform the Cold War. This aspect will be discussed in relation to the Persian Gulf War; the rise of the Neocons; American invasion of Iraq; NATO in eastern Europe; China; the Arab Spring and the current situation in Ukraine.
