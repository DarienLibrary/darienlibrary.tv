On Wednesday, August 2, 2017, Dr. Gil Harel presented the third part in his classical music lecture series. 

With the death of Beethoven in 1827, composers of the century attempted to emerge from the shadow of the maestro. This took them in new musical directions, where innovation and originality were of paramount importance. From the songs of Schubert to the Ã©tudes of Chopin, to the mighty symphonies of Brahms, we will explore this century through the lens of some of its most storied figures.
