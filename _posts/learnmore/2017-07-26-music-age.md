On Thursday, July 26, 2017, Dr. Gil Harel presented his second music lecture. 

In the second half of the 18th century, European society experienced a paradigm shift in thought and structure. In France, thinkers such as Voltaire and Diderot would usher in an age known as the "Enlightenment." As society evolved, so too did music. In this age of reason, the music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven flourished. To this day, they remain some of the most influential composers in the western canon.
