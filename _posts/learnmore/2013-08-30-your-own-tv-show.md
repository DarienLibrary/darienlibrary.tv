On Friday, August 30, 2013 Rich Turcsany, Public Access Coordinator, discussed what it takes to put together your very own, non-commercial television program, and have it broadcast over Public Access Channel 88. 

Rich, a 1986 graduate of Emerson College in Boston, and who also has 26 years experience in cable TV, will also discuss the training that is involved.
