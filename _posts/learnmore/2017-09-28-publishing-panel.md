About the Panelists

National bestselling author Jamie Beck’s realistic and heartwarming stories have sold more than one million copies. She is a 2017 Booksellers’ Best Award finalist, and her books have hit Heavy.com’s “Top 10 Romance Novels of 2015” and have been selected as a Woman’s World Book Club pick. In addition to writing novels, she enjoys dancing around the kitchen while cooking and hitting the slopes in Vermont and Utah. Above all, she is a grateful wife and mother to a very patient, supportive family.

Patience Bloom is a senior editor for Harlequin Romantic Suspense. At Harlequin, she tends to work on a wide spectrum of romances—from Love Inspired to Harlequin Dare, with a specialization in suspense. Prior to joining Harlequin in 1997, Patience taught French and Latin at Sandia Preparatory School in New Mexico. She holds a B.A. in French and Latin from Oberlin College and a master’s degree in French Literature from the University of New Mexico. She is the author of her own true romance, Romance Is My Day Job.

Jane Haertel writes mysteries as Sadie Hartwell (the Tangled Web Mysteries) and Susannah Hardy (the Greek to Me Mysteries). She has worked as a handbag designer, waitress, and office drone until she landed her dream jobs in the book business. In addition to authoring books of her own, Jane also works full-time as a lead editor at Annie's Fiction, a specialty book club publisher. She lives in Connecticut with her husband, son, and her tuxedo cat, Elvira.

Award-winning author Erika Kelly has been spinning romantic tales all her life—she just didn’t know it. Raised on the classics, she didn’t discover romantic fiction until later in life. From that moment on, she’s been devouring the genre and finding her true voice as an author. Over three decades she’s written poems, screenplays, plays, short stories, and contemporary women’s fiction novels. Married to the love of her life and raising four children, she’s lived in two countries and seven states, but currently makes her home in Connecticut.

Wendy Walker is the author of the national and international bestseller All is Not Forgotten, with rights sold in twenty-two languages. Film rights have been sold to Warner Brothers with Reese Witherspoon and Pacific Standard producing. She previously published two novels and edited multiple compilations for the Chicken Soup for the Soul series. Prior to her writing career, Wendy practiced family law, having earned her J. D. from Georgetown University Law Center and her undergraduate degree from Brown University. Wendy is currently finishing her second thriller and managing a busy household in Fairfield County, Connecticut where she lives with her three sons.
