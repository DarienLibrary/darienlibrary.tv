On Monday, January 23, 2017, Mark Albertson was back to present a one-off lecture on the Cuba and Platt Amendment.
Join us for a lecture on the 1903 Platt Amendment. With President McKinley's eviction of the Spanish from Cuba, the Cuban people soon learned they were trading one overseer for another. For with the Platt Amendment--named for its presenter in Congress, Senator Orville Platt of Connecticut--a DIKTAT was impressed upon the Cuban people denying them access to a long cherished sovereignty denied them while under the yoke of Spanish rule. The Platt Amendment showcased the new definition of Manifest Destiny, from an agenda of Continental expansion to a program for globalism.
