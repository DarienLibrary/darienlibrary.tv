On Monday, April 18, 2018, we learned more about the one of the globe's most fascinating and misunderstood religions. 

Haj Amin al-Husseini (the infamous Grand Mufti of Jerusalem); Sayyid Qutb, theoretician of consequence; General Khairallah Talfah (Saddam Husseinâ€™s uncle) and mentor of Yasser Arafat; Hassan al-Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood. This session will spotlight those practitioners of radicalism who set the stage for the likes of Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama bin-Laden, and Abu Musab al Zarqawi.
