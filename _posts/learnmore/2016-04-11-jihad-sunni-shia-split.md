On Monday, April 11, 2016, patron-favorite instructor, Mark Albertson, joined us for the first lecture in a four-week introductory class on one of the globe's most fascinating and misunderstood religions.

In 570 Muhammad ibn Abdallah, AKA, the one true Prophet, Muhammad, was born. This session will explore his organization of a movement that has come to be known as Islam. In so doing he charted the course for the expansion of a vast empire, one that would see to the massive conversion of peoples until finally, today, Islam boasts over 1 billion adherents. With his death, though, the seeds were planted for a discord among the Faithful which afflicts their beloved religion to the present day, the Sunni-Shia Split.
