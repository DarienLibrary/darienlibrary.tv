On Wednesday, October 10, 2012, Aldo Pantano, a representative from the CT Partnership for Long-Term Care, with the State Office of Policy and Management was our speaker. 

You've thought of everything -- except for how to protect your assets should you need long-term care. Did you know that just one year in a Connecticut nursing home can cost more than $134,000? And Medicare and health insurance may only cover a fraction of these costs. Now there's a way to protect your life savings. If you're 40 or older, long-term care insurance approved by the State's Connecticut Partnership for Long-Term Care should be part of your retirement plan. These policies assure you of the highest quality standards. They're affordable and provide asset protection, protect against inflation, and -- most importantly -- give you peace of mind through your retirement years. Come learn about how the State's Partnership for Long-Term Care can help you plan ahead for your future needs.
