On Thursday, March 6, 2014, Molleen Theodore joined us from MoMA to discuss Ileana Sonnabend: Ambassador for the New. In a career as gallerist and noted collector, Sonnabend helped shape the course of postwar art in Europe and North America. In addition to introducing American Pop art and Minimalism to Europe and in bringing Italian Arte Povera to the United States, Sonnabend sought out and championed many of the most significant artists of her time.

Molleen Theodore is the Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Fellow in the Education Department at the Yale University Art Gallery and a lecturer in the Education Department at the Museum of Modern Art. She received her Ph.D. from the CUNY Graduate Center in 2010 with a specialization in twentieth century art, photography, and film studies.

This event is part of Darien Library's collaboration with the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in Manhattan in 2013-14. Stay tuned for special library programs and additions to our collection like modern art books, iPads, and museum passes. This collaboration is designed to enhance the Darien community's appreciation for and knowledge of modern art.
