On Monday, October 29, 2018, Mark presented the second lecture in his Civil War era series. 

Join us for a four-week series on The Civil War and learn about the tension between those who enlist the agrarian agenda and those that desire to industrialize.

Week Two: Southern Aristocracy
Join us for week two as we discuss Slaveocracy of the American Gulag, class structure of the Antebellum South, Manifest Destiny and the unfolding decline of Southern political power. All of which leads to burgeoning Southern radicalism and the secessionist movement.
