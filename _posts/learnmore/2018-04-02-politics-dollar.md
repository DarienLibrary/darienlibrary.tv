On Monday, April 2, 2018, Mark Albertson presented the last lecture in his Politics of the Dollar series.

Week 4: Petrodollar
The price of oil is based on the dollar, providing a decisive advantage for the United States. Yet in 2000, Saddam Hussein moved Iraq’s oil transactions off the Dollar and onto the Euro. Shortly after invading Iraq in March 2003, Washington moved Iraq’s oil transactions off the Euro and back onto the Dollar. Our series concludes with the fate of the Dollar and American debt.
