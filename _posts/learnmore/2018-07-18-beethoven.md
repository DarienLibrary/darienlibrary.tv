On Wednesday, July 18, 2018, Gil Harel returned for the second lecture in his Beethoven series. 

Week 2: The 'Heroic' Beethoven
Though his reputation had been established with early masterpieces (such as the "Sonata Path√©tique"), Beethoven's legacy was perhaps cemented when he completed his Symphony no. 3 (Sinfonia Eroica) in 1803. Contemporary accounts relate that audiences were initially polarized by the work, as it presented them with a symphony whose length and scope was completely unprecedented. Historians, connoisseurs, and casual listeners alike are often fascinated by this work for many reasons. Chief among these is the fact that Beethoven's hearing had deteriorated considerably by the time the symphony was premiered. The composer's resolve to write music in the face of this relentless malady planted the seeds for the Demigod status future artists would confer upon him.
