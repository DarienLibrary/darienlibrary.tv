On Wednesday, February 14, 2018, Gil Harel gave his final lecture in his Mozart series. 

Among the many mysteries of Mozart's life, his death undoubtedly constitutes the greatest one. Used as the central plot-line of the award-winning film Amadeus, the death of Mozart has long fascinated scholars and casual listeners alike. During this program we will consider several "late" works, including his final symphony, his clarinet concerto, and finally, his Requiem.
