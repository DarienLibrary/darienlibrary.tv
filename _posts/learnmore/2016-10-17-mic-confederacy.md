On Monday, October 17, 2016, we were joined again by Mark Albertson for a new series: The Military Industrial Complex. 

The premise of States' Rights was one of the hallmarks of the Confederacy as a Revolution. The Southern Aristocracy, with its slave economy, would be subsumed, as the idea of States' Rights would be, by the industrialization of the South. The effort in building a Military-Industrial Complex so as to be able to wage conventional war helps to undermine the Confederacy, as a government billed as having been an example of States' Rights gives way to a centralized form of government built on fighting a war which would see to the end of the Confederacy. The Confederacy would die in a losing effort of Total War.
