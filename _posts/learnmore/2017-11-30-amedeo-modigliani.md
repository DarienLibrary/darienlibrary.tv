Inspired by the Jewish Museum’s current exhibition, Modigliani: Unmasked, our talk seeks to appreciate the beauty and significance of Amedeo Modigliani’s art. A sculptor at heart, Modigliani’s practice remained forever inflected by the lens of this medium and driven by global influences from across the centuries. Melding disparate plastic traditions from Africa and Ancient Greece with traits from Southeast Asian sculpture and Italian Renaissance painting, Modigliani probed and celebrated the concept of “otherness,” a label with special resonance for him as both a foreigner and a Jew.

From his arrival in Paris in 1906 until his untimely death in 1920 at the age of 35, the impoverished and famously charming Italian artist found a true spiritual home in the bohemian community of Montparnasse, among a stylistically and culturally diverse group of poets and painters from all over Eastern Europe and as far away as Mexico and Japan. Together, we will explore the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of identity, ethnicity, and imagery that was Modigliani’s world.

The Darien Library is proud to cosponsor this event with the Jewish Historical Society of Fairfield County. Refreshments will be served. Can't make the live event? Check out the video recording at DarienLibrary.tv.
