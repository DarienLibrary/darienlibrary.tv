Week one of Mark Albertson's latest series. He joined us on Monday, January 8, 2018. 

Join us for a lecture on Joseph Stalin, a man who left many legacies, but one of the most defining was that he took a nation from a backward peasant economy to an atomic bomb in 21 years.

# Week 1: Joseph Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili
Learn about the Georgian chieftain’s life, from childhood to the Russian Revolution. As a bank robber, he “procured” funds for the Bolsheviks and, for his actions, would be consigned to Siberia at least seven times, escaping six. By 1917, Stalin was set to launch his political career as one of the dominate figures in the Bolshevik Party.
