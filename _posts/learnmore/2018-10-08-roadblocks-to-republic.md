On Monday, October 8, 2018, Mark Albertson presented the last lecture in his Roadblocks to Republic series. 

America’s founding as a Republic was not without its impediments; so inspired as they were from the ranks of the Revolutionary Generation themselves. Join us for this four-week series as we discuss.

Week Four: Manifesto of American Fascism.
August 23, 1971, Lewis F. Powell, Jr., nominated to the Supreme Court by President Richard Nixon, penned a, “Confidential Memorandum: Attack on American Free Enterprise System.” This document follows the tumultuous 1960s, replete with the raucous Civil Rights movement, the convulsive Anti-War agenda, and the “revolutionary temerity” of students as well as academics calling into question the rudiments of America’s State Religion, Capitalism.
