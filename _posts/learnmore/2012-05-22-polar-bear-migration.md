On Tuesday, May 22, 2012, in an event co-sponsored by Northern Trust, we are proud to welcome Andy Griswold, Director of Eco-Travel for Connecticut Audubon Society (CAS).

Hudson Bay is the land of the Polar Bear, Ursus maritimus. This lecture will show you the bears in their spectacular habitat and one of the world's most wonderful natural phenomena, the annual Polar Bear Migration along the Hudson Bay coast. Because of the relative ease of accessing this sub-population, Churchill is referred to as "The Polar Bear Capital of the World." The bears are not the only attraction as the austere desert-like tundra gives rise to breathtaking views of Arctic Fox, Arctic Hare, Snowy Owl, Gyrfalcon, and other wildlife against a magnificent backdrop.
