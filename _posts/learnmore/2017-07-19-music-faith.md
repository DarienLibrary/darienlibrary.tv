On Wednesday, July 19, 2017, Gil Harel presented the first lecture in his classical music series. 

The music of J.S. Bach has come to represent the culmination of the period historians refer to as "baroque." During this program, we will explore several of his works, including a vocal genre known as the "church cantata" as well as a complex and polyphonic organ fugue. As we unravel the nature of these works, we will consider the signature phrase that Bach included at the end of every manuscript: Soli Deo Gloria - "For the glory of God alone."
