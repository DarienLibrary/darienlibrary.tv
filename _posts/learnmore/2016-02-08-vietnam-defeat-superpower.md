On Monday, February 8th, 2016, we were joined for the final lecture of this Vietnam series.
America's defeat in Vietnam is the topic of this presentation, spanning the years 1961 to 1973. The gradual build up of American forces in the early part of the conflict until1965, when the massing of forces accelerated. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, President Johnson's micro-management the war, rising domestic tensions in the United States, TET offensive, the air bombing of North Vietnam, the Paris Peace talks, the eventual American defeat, will all be discussed.
