On Monday, November 6, 2017, Mark Albertson delivered the final lecture in his four-part series on the Russian Revolution. 

This four-week series traces one of the defining events of the 20th century: The Russian Revolution. The journey will begin with an explanation of Marx’s and Engel’s Communist Manifesto, culminating with Stalin’s rise to power. The collapse of the Romanovs will be showcased followed by the rise of the Bolsheviks. Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin and others will be profiled. Central to this four-week sojourn into history will be the irrevocable changes sweeping across Europe following the French Revolution; focusing, of course, on the collapse of Czarist Russia and the advent of Bolshevik Russia; hence, the Soviet Union.

Week 4: Consolidation of Power/Rise of Stalin

Peasantry and Proletariat, Lenin's death, Trotsky vs. Stalin, and the eventual rise of Stalin will all be discussed in today's final lecture.
