On Monday, February 1, 2016, speaker Mark Albertson was back for the third part of this Vietnam series (second one filmed).

Armored warfare and motorized transport transformed mobility in the 20th century. After the Second World War, cavalry took a different form with the helicopter. With rotary wing aircraft, troops and supplies could now be moved over obstacles which impeded rival forms of ground transportation. Shifting from horseback to air mobility will be the focus on this week's talk.
