On Wednesday, March 14, 2018, Eric Chandler returned with a new lecture. 

George Washington, Paul Revere, the Marquis de Lafayette are all names we were taught in school as having been heroes of the American War for Independence. Molly Pitcher is a name we see given to a rest stop on the New Jersey Turnpike. But who was Molly Pitcher?

Women in the American Revolution: Putting the ‘Her’ in Heroics will introduce you to some of the women who risked their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor to lift the yoke of British control of the 13 Colonies. Women who are missing from our history books, their stories as soldiers and spies left untold.
