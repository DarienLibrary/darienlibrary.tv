On Monday, January 22, 2018, Mark Albertson presented the third lecture in his Stalin's Revolution series. 

Join us for a lecture on Joseph Stalin, a man who left many legacies, but one of the most defining was that he took a nation from a backward peasant economy to an atomic bomb in 21 years.

### Week 3: Stalin’s Revolution
In 1927 Stalin began his program of collectivization of the peasantry in an effort to mold the Soviet Union in his image followed, in turn, by his forced industrialization of the nation. He was preparing Mother Russia for the continuation of the 1914-1918 conflict and would purge the Party of many of the old-line Bolsheviks with his merciless use of the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, the Narodnyi Kommissariat Vnutrennikh or NKVD, forerunner of the KGB. Stalin’s employment of State Capitalism and draconian discipline would result in his becoming a totalitarian ruler.
