On Monday, September 25, 2017, Mark Albertson presented his second lecture on Women in American History.

This series will bring to the fore a number of women who irrevocably changed the political and social dynamics of the modern world. These women made their marks in a variety of venues: political, social, human and civil rights, literature and even aviation. Their contributions to the advancement of modern America, in addition to other women to numerous here to name, are many times forgotten or, if not forgotten, lack the appreciation required by those who truly benefit from their accomplishments and sacrifices.

Week 2: Susan B. Anthony

Born in 1820 to a Quaker family, Susan B. Anthony would become a leading social reformer, women’s rights activist, as well as having been an abolitionist committed to social equality. An individual of great commitment to purpose, she would run for public office in New York, even at the risk of going to jail. She would help create the Women’s State Temperance Society in New York but will forever be known as a tireless champion for the Women’s Right to Vote.
