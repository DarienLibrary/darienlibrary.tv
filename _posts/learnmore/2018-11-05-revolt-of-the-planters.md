On Monday, November 5, 2018, Mark Albertson presented his third lecture in the Revolt of the Planters series. 

Join us for a four-week series on The Civil War and learn about the tension between those who enlist the agrarian agenda and those that desire to industrialize.

Week Three: Confederacy as a Revolution
The Confederacy was a revolution from the Right; an attempt to insure the primacy of a restricted clique of Land Gentry and the notion of Cottonism. Like the Fascists in Italy and the Nazi Revolution in Germany, the Southern Aristocracy represents that Rightist repugnance for the ideals of the Age of Reason/Enlightenment.
