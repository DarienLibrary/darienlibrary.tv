On Wednesday, November 2, 2016, we were joined by Dr. Elizabeth R. Marsh. 

Program Director, Joshua Herbert, MD, Darien Library, and Stamford Hospital, cordially invite the public to attend this five week series of lectures that mimic the structure of the medical school experience. Each night will focus on one topic and cover the anatomy, function, common disease states, and available treatments. The physicians are board certified in their area of speciality and leaders in their fields.

Dr. Marsh will speak on skin cancer, sunscreens, and simple skin care to "freshen not frighten."
