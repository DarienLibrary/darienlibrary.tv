On Wednesday, July 25, 2018, Gil Harel presented the third lecture in his Beethoven series. 

Week 3: Fate Knocking at the Door: Beethoven's Symphony no. 5
Perhaps no musical motive is as iconic and instantly recognizable as that which begins Beethoven's Symphony no. 5 in C minor. Contemporary accounts suggest that this music strikes us today much as it struck listeners 200 years ago. Audience members are often captivated by the sense of gloom and urgency which begins the work, and are taken along an odyssey which introduces lyrical determination (mvt. 2) before yielding to a demonic scherzo (mvt. 3) and finally melting into the triumphant fanfare of the finale. The symphony constitutes an important watershed in the development of classical music, and marks what many commentators describe as a foreshadowing of the romantic style. For Beethoven, the symphony may have symbolized something deeply personal.
