On Monday, September 18, 2017, we kicked off our new lecture series with Mark Albertson. 

This series will bring to the fore a number of women who irrevocably changed the political and social dynamics of the modern world. These women made their marks in a variety of venues: political, social, human and civil rights, literature and even aviation. Their contributions to the advancement of modern America, in addition to other women to numerous here to name, are many times forgotten or, if not forgotten, lack the appreciation required by those who truly benefit from their accomplishments and sacrifices.

Week 1: Harriet Tubman

Abolitionist, humanitarian, Union Army spy, armed scout, cook, nurse, suffragette, lecturer, civil rights activist, a remarkable list of accomplishments for one who was born into slavery. A devout Christian, Harriet Tubman was often known for a time as “Moses” due to her courageous actions of slipping into the South to bring out those looking to be free from the bondage of slavery. Following her death, a survey taken at the end of the twentieth century saw this black named as one of the most famous civilians in the history of this Nation, finishing third behind Betsy Ross and Paul Revere.
