On Monday, January 15, 2018, Mark Albertson presented the second in his Stalin's Revolution lecture series. 

Join us for a lecture on Joseph Stalin, a man who left many legacies, but one of the most defining was that he took a nation from a backward peasant economy to an atomic bomb in 21 years.

### Week 2: Stalin and the Revolution
Considered an expert in nationalities, Lenin names Stalin as the head of the Commissariat for Nationality Affairs. Stalin goes on to assist Trotsky and Lenin with emergency decisions during the initial period of the Civil War. Learn about Stalin eventually becoming Commissar for State Control and, as Secretary-General of the Party in 1922, Stalin would put together that powerbase which would enable him to outmaneuver Trotsky to become Leninâ€™s successor.
