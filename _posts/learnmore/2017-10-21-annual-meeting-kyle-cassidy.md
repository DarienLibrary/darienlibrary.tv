On Saturday, October 21, 2017, we held our Annual Meeting of the Friends of Darien Library. Our guest speaker was photographer and author, Kyle Cassidy. His talk starts at 17:38.

Friends of the Darien Library cordially invite you to the Annual Meeting. Kyle Cassidy, author and photographer of This is What a Librarian Looks Like, will be our featured speaker.

This is What a Librarian Looks Like is a photographic and written ode to more than 200 librarians and libraries from all 50 states and Canada, their essential value to our communities, and the importance of open access to information for all.

Prior to Kyle's presentation, learn about the year's developments from Kevin Gasvoda, President of the Board. Election of officers and new trustee nominations for the 2017-18 year will be held.

A reception and book signing to follow. Books will be available for purchase courtesy of Barrett Bookstore.

About the Book

Kyle Cassidy has made it his mission to remind us of how essential librarians and libraries are to our communities, and how close we are to losing so many of them. Kyle spent hundreds of hours traveling around the country photographing and interviewing librarians for this project. His subjects are men and women of all ages, backgrounds, and personal style-from pink hair and leather jackets to button-downs and blazers. In short, not necessarily what one thinks a librarian looks like.

Cassidy profiles a number of exemplary libraries and librarians that serve their communities in unique ways, from Bretagne Byrd, who drives a bookmobile across Montana bringing free Wi-Fi to rural towns that have none, to Nick Higgins who runs outreach services at the Brooklyn Public Library and launched a video conferencing program that allows children to read a book, face-to-face with an incarcerated parent.
