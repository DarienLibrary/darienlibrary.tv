On Monday, October 1, 2018, Mark Albertson presented the third lecture in his Roadblocks to Republic series. 

Americaâ€™s founding as a Republic was not without its impediments; so inspired as they were from the ranks of the Revolutionary Generation themselves. Join us for this four-week series as we discuss.

Week Three: The Business Plot
Gleaned from the records of the 1934 McCormack-Dickstein Committee Hearings, or House of Un-American Activities Committee, is the investigation of the 1933 plot against President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Pitcairns, the Du Ponts, Gerald McGuire of the Connecticut American Legion, William Doyle of the American Legion, Grayson M.P. Murphy of Guaranty Trust Company are among the players in a sordid plot.
