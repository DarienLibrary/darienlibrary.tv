On Wednesday, October 19, 2016, we were joined by Dr. Christina B. Kunec. 

Program Director, Joshua Herbert, MD, Darien Library, and Stamford Hospital, cordially invite the public to attend this five week series of lectures that mimic the structure of the medical school experience. Each night will focus on one topic and cover the anatomy, function, common disease states, and available treatments. The physicians are board certified in their area of speciality and leaders in their fields.

Concussions affect everyone differently. Concussions can happen from a variety of mechanisms including athletic activities, gym class, camp, motor vehicle accidents, falls, assault, and more. Learn about how Neuropsychology and rehabilitation and physical therapy all help treat concussions as a manageable injury.
