On Thursday, June 22, 2017, we were joined by Mark Albertson for the third lecture in his Nazi Revolution lecture series. 

Most attempts to chronicle the Third Reich seem wedded to the period of 1933-1945. A broader perspective for understanding Hitlerâ€™s Germany is hardly possible unless one engages in the formative years of the Nazi Movement, 1919-1934. From the demise of Imperial Germany to the Night of the Long Knives, this course will chronicle the Nazi Revolution.

Week 3: The Weimar Republic

Our series continues with a look at the German attempt at Representative Government. The structure and process of the Weimar Republic will be covered as well as major personalities.
