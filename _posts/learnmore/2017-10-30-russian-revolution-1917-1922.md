On Monday, October 30, 2017, Mark Albertson presented the third part in his Russian Revolution lecture series.

This four-week series traces one of the defining events of the 20th century: The Russian Revolution. The journey will begin with an explanation of Marx’s and Engel’s Communist Manifesto, culminating with Stalin’s rise to power. The collapse of the Romanovs will be showcased followed by the rise of the Bolsheviks. Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin and others will be profiled. Central to this four-week sojourn into history will be the irrevocable changes sweeping across Europe following the French Revolution; focusing, of course, on the collapse of Czarist Russia and the advent of Bolshevik Russia; hence, the Soviet Union.

Week 3: Civil War in Russia, December 1917-December 1922

Felix Dzerzhinsky and the Cheka, the Red Army, White Russians, Russo-Polish War, 1919-1921, and the Treaty of Rapallo, April 1922 will all be discussed.
