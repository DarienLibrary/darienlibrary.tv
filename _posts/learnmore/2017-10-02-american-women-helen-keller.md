On Monday, October 2, 2017, Mark Albertson presented the third in his Women in American History series. 

This series will bring to the fore a number of women who irrevocably changed the political and social dynamics of the modern world. These women made their marks in a variety of venues: political, social, human and civil rights, literature and even aviation. Their contributions to the advancement of modern America, in addition to other women to numerous here to name, are many times forgotten or, if not forgotten, lack the appreciation required by those who truly benefit from their accomplishments and sacrifices.

Week 3: Helen Keller

Born in 1880 in Tuscumbia, Alabama, Helen Keller would lose her sight and ability to hear at age 19 months. This would set the stage for one of the most remarkable ladies in American history. A determined individual who would show that physical disabilities can overcome so as to make positive contributions to humanity. She would travel to some 40 nations conveying her message and forged her example as an inspiration to her fellow man. Politically she was a Socialist, ardent pacifist and warned of the overweening power of the privileged over the masses.
