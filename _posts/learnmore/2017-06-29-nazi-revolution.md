On Thursday, June 29, 2017, Mark Albertson wrapped up his four-part lecture series on the Nazi Revolution. 

Most attempts to chronicle the Third Reich seem wedded to the period of 1933-1945. A broader perspective for understanding Hitlerâ€™s Germany is hardly possible unless one engages in the formative years of the Nazi Movement, 1919-1934. From the demise of Imperial Germany to the Night of the Long Knives, this course will chronicle the Nazi Revolution.

Week 4: The Night of the Long Knives

Hitler assumes the chancellorship, January 30, 1933, but tensions run high. Our series concludes with The Reichstag Fire, the trial of Marinus Van Der Lubbe, the SA and the Liberal Wing of the Nazi Party, Black Guard of the Right and the bloody climax: Night of the Long Knives.
