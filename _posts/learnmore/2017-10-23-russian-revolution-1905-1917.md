On Monday, October 23, 2017, Mark Albertson presented the second lecture in his Russian Revolution lecture. 

This four-week series traces one of the defining events of the 20th century: The Russian Revolution. The journey will begin with an explanation of Marx’s and Engel’s Communist Manifesto, culminating with Stalin’s rise to power. The collapse of the Romanovs will be showcased followed by the rise of the Bolsheviks. Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin and others will be profiled. Central to this four-week sojourn into history will be the irrevocable changes sweeping across Europe following the French Revolution; focusing, of course, on the collapse of Czarist Russia and the advent of Bolshevik Russia; hence, the Soviet Union.

Week 2: Revolution in Russia: January 1905-December 1917

Week 2 will cover the Russo-Japanese War, a Provisional Government and end with the Bolsheviks seizing power in November 1917.
