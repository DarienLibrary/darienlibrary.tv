On Monday, September 17, 2018, we welcomed Mark Albertson back for the first lecture in his new series.

America’s founding as a Republic was not without its impediments; so inspired as they were from the ranks of the Revolutionary Generation themselves. Join us for this four-week series as we discuss.

Week One: The Newburgh Incident
Despite its victory over the world’s ranking colonial power, The Continental Army was in a restive state. Mutinies occurred among some line regiments, there was a lack of food, poverty of clothing, and arrears of financial reimbursement. The potential of an officers’ rebellion showcased the potential political threat facing the Continental Congress, a military coup. George Washington rose to the challenge, at Newburgh, on March 15, 1783.
