On Monday, October 22, 2018, Mark Albertson kicked off the first lecture in his new series. 

Join us for a four-week series on The Civil War and learn about the tension between those who enlist the agrarian agenda and those that desire to industrialize.

Week One: People Who Own the Country Ought to Govern It
We the People was based on the ability to own land, yet the threat posed to the landed interests by Northern merchants and industrialization was evident with the founding of the Nation. The stage was set for the contradictions posed by the Jeffersonian versus the Hamiltonian doctrines for political primacy.
