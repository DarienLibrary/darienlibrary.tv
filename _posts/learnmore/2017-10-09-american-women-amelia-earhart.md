On Monday, October 9, 2017, Mark Albertson delivered the fourth lecture in his Women in American History series. 

This series will bring to the fore a number of women who irrevocably changed the political and social dynamics of the modern world. These women made their marks in a variety of venues: political, social, human and civil rights, literature and even aviation. Their contributions to the advancement of modern America, in addition to other women to numerous here to name, are many times forgotten or, if not forgotten, lack the appreciation required by those who truly benefit from their accomplishments and sacrifices.

Week 4: Amelia Earhart

An intriguing aspect of the Amelia Earhart story is that there is no closure, and speculation as to her exact fate persists to this present day. Amelia Earhart helped blaze a trail in aviation for women. A vehement proponent of Womenâ€™s Rights who on her wedding day informed her betrothed, publisher George Palmer Putnam, that she would not be restricted to medieval conventions pertaining to marriage. Amelia Earhart and other female aviators of the period served as inspirations for those intrepid ladies who would cross the Atlantic in World War II delivering aircraft to the Allied air forces in the European Theater of War.
