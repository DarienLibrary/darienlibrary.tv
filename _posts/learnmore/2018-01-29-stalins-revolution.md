On Monday, January 29, 2018, Mark Albertson presented the final lecture in his four-part series.

Join us for a lecture on Joseph Stalin, a man who left many legacies, but one of the most defining was that he took a nation from a backward peasant economy to an atomic bomb in 21 years.

### Week 4: The Generalissimo
On June 22, 1941, Adolf Hitler hurled 3,300,000 German troops against the Soviet Union. A conflict which would help to see the transformation of the global dynamics of power, for the European colonial powers no longer dominated global affairs. A new balance of power arose to fill the void, the United States and the Soviet Union. The postwar history of the Soviet Union will be covered, up to the death of Stalin, March 5, 1953.
