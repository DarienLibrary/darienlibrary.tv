In the spring, Darien Library hosted the Marine Art Exhibit. Marine Art is regarded as one of the most popular forms of fine art. In practice, it takes many forms, including painting, drawing, printmaking, beach scenes, and all art showing boats. At the close of the show, we had the opportunity to interview Phil Meyer, whose incredible model ships had graced Main Street during the exhibit. In this interview Mr. Meyer talks about the art and craft of model ship building, and points out the details of each of the ships that were displayed.
