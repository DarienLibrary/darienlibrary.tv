On Saturday, October 17, 2015, Kristen Harnisch, author of The Vintner's Daughter, was our featured speaker. Kristen will discuss how Darien Library helped her transition from banker, to stay-at-home mom, to debut novelist. The Vintner's Daughter is a captivating story that immerses readers in the rich cultures of the Loire Valley, Napa, and New York and a tenacious heroine's fight to determine her own destiny.

Prior to Kristen's presentation, learn about the year's developments from Amy Cholnoky, President of the Board. Election of new trustees for the 2015-16 year will be held.
