Our guest speaker for the night was Kate Manning, author of My Notorious Life. This novel is the evocative, absolutely unforgettable new novel from Kate Manning. Inspired by the true story of Ann Trow Lohman, a female physician who became one of the most controversial figures in Victorian New York City. My Notorious Life, now published in paperback, vibrantly portrays a charismatic, passionate woman who changed the lives of countless others.
