On Thursday, May 15, 2014, we were joined by two audiobook actors and a producer.
About Tavia Gilbert
Six-time Audie nominee and multiple Earphones and Parent's Choice Award-winning producer, narrator, and writer Tavia Gilbert has appeared on stage and in film. Library Journal said this of the highly-acclaimed actress "as close as you can get to a full cast narration with a solo voice." She has narrated more than 250 multi-cast and single-voice audiobooks. A few of her most recent narrations are Blue Plate Special, Mothers, True Love and We are Water.
About Dennis Boutsikaris

He is a two-time Obie-winning stage actor who was the first American actor to play Mozart on Broadway in "Amadeus" and appeared in the 2009 short-lived revival of "Brighton Beach Memoirs." Dennis' "transporting voice" can be heard on over 125 audiobooks. He is the recipient of six Audie Awards, given by the Audio Publishers Association. And, nine of his recordings have been given AudioFile Earphones Awards, including Neil Gaiman's American Gods: Tenth Anniversary Edition, Philip Roth's Nemesis, John Grisham's The Litigators, and Stephen Kings' Firestarter.
