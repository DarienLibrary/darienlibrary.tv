On Wednesday, April 6, 2016, the Library hosted an overview of the Downtown Darien Proposal. 

David Genovese, founder of Baywater Properties, will present to the public an overview of the downtown Darien redevelopment project proposed by Baywater Properties and its partner, PG Properties.  A full presentation of the project will be given to attendees, with significant time available for questions and comments.

The Baywater venture began work on acquiring the properties from Corbin Drive to the Bank of America Building, including the US Post Office at 30 Corbin Drive and 10 Corbin Drive, in 2005.  In July of 2015, Baywater presented the initial concept for its redevelopment proposal to a joint meeting of the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Architectural Review Board.  Baywater will soon be filing its next application to the Planning & Zoning Commission, with a goal of attaining all approvals by the end of 2016.

All presentations made to the Town of Darien and other groups are available for viewing here, as are the written presentations, studies, and inspirational materials which have influenced the decision-making of Baywater and its team.  A Facebook page, Your Downtown Darien, is also maintained and provides updates on the process and decisions as they are made.
