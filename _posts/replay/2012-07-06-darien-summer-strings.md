On Friday, July 6, 2012, the Darien Summer Chamber Orchestra treated us to an hour long musical session on the Library's terrace. Under the direction of Jane Minnis, the Orchestra is an ensemble of 20 middle school and high school string players. The group performs classical and popular music favorites at local venues.
