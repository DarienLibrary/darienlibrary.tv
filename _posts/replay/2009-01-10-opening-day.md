On Saturday, January 10, 2009, Darien Library opened its doors for the first time at 1441 Post Road in Darien CT. January 10th that year was proclaimed "Darien Library Day" in the State of Connecticut. You can also see in this video, Harold W. McGraw Jr., a dear friend of Darien Library. We opened the Library on his 91st birthday. The Children's Library is officially named after Mr. McGraw.
