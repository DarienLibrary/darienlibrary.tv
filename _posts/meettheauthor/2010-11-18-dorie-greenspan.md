On November 18, 2010, Dorie Greenspan visited Darien Library. She has been called “a culinary guru” by The New York Times. She is the author of the James Beard Award-winning "Baking: From My Home to Yours", which inspired the creation of the online baking community “Tuesdays with Dorie.” Currently, her brand new book, "Around My French Table," is winning raves and fans. Dorie Greenspan’s appearance was made possible by Barrett Bookstore. For more information, please visit: http://www.darienlibrary.org/2010/11/10/meet-author-dorie-greenspan-thursday-november-18-7-pm
