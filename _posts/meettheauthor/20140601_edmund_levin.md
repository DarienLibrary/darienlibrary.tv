On Sunday, June 1, 2014, author Edmund Levin, the writer of "A Child of Christian Blood" was our featured speaker. 

On March 20, 1911, thirteen-year-old Andrei Yushchinsky was found stabbed to death in a cave on the outskirts of Kiev. Four months later, Russian police arrested Mendel Beilis, a 37-year-old father of five who worked as a clerk in a brick factory nearby, and charged him not only with Andrei's murder but also with the Jewish ritual murder of a Christian child. Despite the fact that there was no evidence linking him to the crime, that he had a solid alibi, and that his main accuser was a professional criminal who was herself under suspicion for the murder, Beilis was imprisoned for more than two years before being brought to trial. This is the story of a Jewish factory worker who is falsely accused of ritually murdering a Christian boy in Russia in 1913, and the trial that followed.
