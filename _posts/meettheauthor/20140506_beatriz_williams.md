As the summer of 1938 begins, New York socialite Lily Dane has arrived at her family's idyllic cottage on the Rhode Island coast with her mother and six-year-old sister in tow. Seven years earlier, as a Smith College senior, Lily fell head-over-heels for Dartmouth quarterback Nick Greenwald in a whirlwind romance gone wrong. Now, after a difficult year, Lily is looking forward to a rejuvenating respite in the place that helped her heal after her broken engagement.

But her plan is upended when Budgie, her ex-best friend, and Lily's former fianc√© arrive in Seaview for the season. Newly married to Nick, Budgie intends to restore her family's cottage and reclaim her spot in Seaview's posh social scene. The pair's arrival rekindles a wildfire of gossip and casts a pall over Lily's beloved home-away-from-home. In this small, class-conscious community, Lily is hard-pressed to avoid her faithless ex-friend. Budgie is nothing if not seductive and resourceful and she soon pulls kindhearted Lily back into her orbit, insinuating herself into Lily's good graces. As a cataclysmic hurricane churns north through the Atlantic, and uneasy secrets slowly reveal themselves, Lily and Nick will confront an emotional storm that will change their worlds forever.

Slipping gracefully back and forth between fictional Seaview and glimmering moneyed New York in the '30s, A Hundred Summers brilliantly captures the time after the Great Depression and with the uncertainty of war on the horizon, and the twin devastations heaped upon a community that summer: the loss of innocence and the loss of a way of life.
