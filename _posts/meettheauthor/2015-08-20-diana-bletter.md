On Thursday, August 20, 2015, Diana Bletter, author of A Remarkable Kindness, was our featured speaker.

In the seaside village of Peleg, four American women have emigrated to Israel for very different reasons. Despite their differences in age and outlook, these four women find each other in ritual, gathering in a burial circle to perform tahara, a final burial rite, for the women of the community. As their intertwined stories unfold, each woman finds the joys promised by the beauty of the land, in new life, first love, motherhood, and friendship, supporting each other through irrevocable changes, navigating the pressures of marriage, illicit romance, the loss of a child, and, the unthinkable backdrop for this paradise--war. Through moments of humor and sorrow, each woman takes part in the ultimate act of compassion, helping to close the circle of life.

Brimming with wisdom and intelligence, A Remarkable Kindness is a moving testament to womenâ€™s friendship, tracing the life lines of women who learn to be strong and capturing the paradoxes and promises of the land they learn to call home.
