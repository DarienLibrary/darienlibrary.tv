On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, David Kirchhoff, author of Weight Loss Boss, was our featured speaker.

David Kirchhoff isn't just the President and CEO of Weight Watchers International—he's a member of Weight Watchers® himself and one of its biggest success stories. In this book, Kirchhoff shares his personal story from his slide into full-fledged obesity, to his struggles managing his relationship with food and finding an exercise regimen that sticks. Kirchhoff offers a frank, funny and groundbreaking look at the challenges to losing weight and keeping it off—and makes the case for radically rethinking what it takes to achieve long-term success and a healthy lifestyle that lasts.
