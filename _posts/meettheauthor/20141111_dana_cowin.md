On Tuesday, November 11, 2014, author Dana Cowin joined us to talk about her new book, "Mastering My Mistakes in the Kitchen." 

An uproarious, inspiring cookbook from the longtime editor-in-chief of Food & Wine magazine, in which the first lady of food spills the secret of her culinary ineptitude, while learning—finally—to cook, side-by-side with some of the greatest chefs working today, from David Chang to Alice Waters to Thomas Keller.
