Rediscover falling in love with the perfect partner and the perfect book. Sarah MacLean leads a discussion with three renowned authors on reading and writing for the Romance reader. Some of the smartest, freshest, and most diverse fiction comes from this beloved genre. Whether you enjoy contemporary novels, historical fiction, mystery, thrillers or any number of other themes, there's a romance novel waiting for you.
New York Times, Washington Post & USA Today bestseller Sarah MacLean is the author of historical romance novels that have been translated into more than twenty languages, and winner of back-to-back RITA Awards for best historical romance from the Romance Writers of America.
Sarah is a leading advocate for the romance genre, speaking widely on its place at the nexus of gender and cultural studies. She is the author of a monthly column celebrating the best of the genre for the Washington Post. Her work in support of romance and the women who read it earned her a place on Jezebel.com's Sheroes list of 2014 and led Entertainment Weekly to call her "gracefully furious." A graduate of Smith College & Harvard University, Sarah now lives in New York City with her husband and daughter.
