On Tuesday, July 26, 2016, we were joined by Jennifer Close, author of the new novel "The Hopefuls" for  for a Ladies Night Out.

From the bestselling author of Girls in White Dresses: A glorious sendup of young D.C. and a blazingly honest portrait of a marriage--the finest work yet by one of our most beloved writers.

When Beth arrives in Washington, D.C., she hates everything about it: the confusing traffic circles, the ubiquitous Ann Taylor suits, the humidity that descends each summer. At dinner parties, guests compare their security clearance levels. They leave their BlackBerrys on the table. They speak in acronyms. And once they realize Beth doesn't work in politics, they smile blandly and turn away. But when Beth and her husband, Matt, meet a charismatic White House staffer named Jimmy, and his wife, Ashleigh, the four become inseparable, coordinating brunch, birthdays, and long weekends away. Then: as Jimmy's star rises higher and higher, their friendship--and Beth's relationship with Matt--is threatened by jealousy, competition, and the inevitable rumors.
