On Tuesday, August 28, 2012, local chef, John Barricelli was our featured speaker. He is the author of The Seasonal Baker: Easy Recipes from My Home Kitchen to Make Year-Round.

Both novice and experienced home bakers will love John Barricelli's follow-up to the acclaimed SoNo Baking Company Cookbook; this new, seasonal cookbook, with easier recipes, puts mouthwatering, everyday home baking within reach for even the most harried among us.
