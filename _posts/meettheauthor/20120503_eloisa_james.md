Fresh on the heels of a difficult period in her life, Eloisa James sold her house, took a sabbatical from her university job as a Shakespeare professor, and moved her family to Paris. Paris in Love: A Memoir chronicles Eloisa's joyful year in one of the most beautiful and romantic cities in the world.
