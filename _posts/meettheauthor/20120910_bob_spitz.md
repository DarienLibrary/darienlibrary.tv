On Monday, September 10, 2012, Bob Spitz, author of Dearie: The Remarkable Life of Julia Child was our guest speaker. 

It's rare for someone to emerge in America who can change our attitudes, our beliefs, and our very culture. It's even rarer when that someone is a middle-aged, six-foot three-inch woman whose first exposure to an unsuspecting public is cooking an omelet on a hot plate on a local TV station. And yet, that's exactly what Julia Child did. The warble-voiced doyenne of television cookery became an iconic cult figure and joyous rule-breaker as she touched off the food revolution that has gripped America for more than fifty years. Now, in Bob Spitz's definitive biography, he provides a clear-eyed portrait of one of the most fascinating and influential Americans of our time â€” a woman known to all, yet known by only a few.
