On Tuesday, December 3, 2013, Nicholas Dawidoff, author of "Collision Low Crossers: A Year Inside the Turbulent World of NFL Football", was our featured speaker.

Football is the country's most popular pastime, and yet most of what happens in today's NFL is a mystery. The New York Jets gave Nicholas Dawidoff a security code, a locker, an office in the scouting department, and for an entire year he lived with the team. He has written a vivid, funny, and moving narrative about an emblematic NFL season that deepens the way we know the game.
