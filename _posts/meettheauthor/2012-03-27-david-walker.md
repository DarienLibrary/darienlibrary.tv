America is at a critical crossroads and the choices that our elected officials make in connection with the role of government and its finances over the next five years will largely determine whether our collective future will be better than our past. Dave Walker will outline the facts and offer a range of sensible solutions to help ensure that America stays great and the American Dream stays alive for our families and future generations of Americans.

Hon. David M. Walker is the Founder, President and CEO of the Comeback America Initiative (CAI). In this capacity, he leads CAI's efforts to promote fiscal responsibility and sustainability by engaging the public and assisting key policymakers on a nonpartisan basis to help achieve solutions to America's federal, state, and local fiscal imbalances.
