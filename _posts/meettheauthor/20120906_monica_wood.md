On Thursday, September 6, 2012,  Monica Wood, author of When We Were the Kennedys, was our featured speaker.

This is the true story of life in 1963 Mexico, Maine, when Monica Wood had to grow up too soon after the death of her beloved father, and, together with her three sisters and mother, learn about the bonds of family from within their own four walls to the four walls of their neighbors, to those of the white house and beyond.
