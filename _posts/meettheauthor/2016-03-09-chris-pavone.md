On Wednesday, March 9, 2016, patrons went undercover with Chris Pavone and his world of international intrigue while sipping on some of the wines that are mentioned in his new thriller The Travelers. Following Chris' presentation, Nicholas Roberts Fine Wine hosted an informal wine tasting featuring wines from the regions found in The Travelers.

About The Travelers
Will Rhodes is an international correspondent for Travelers magazine, hopping around the world to write about food and wine, about foreign cultures and glamorous parties, about local celebrities and adventurous expats. He meets a lot of people; harmless flirtation is part of his job. But the sexy Australian who appears at his Argentinean hotel is not at all harmless, and she pulls Will into a complex and dangerous game.

Malcolm Somers runs Travelers, has a beautiful wife and children, a luxurious apartment, private driver—but Malcolm knows that things could unwind at any moment. He is a classic overachiever, but it isn’t his editorial job at Travelers that often keeps him at the office late at night.

Chloe, Will’s wife and former employee of Travelers, is now working freelance on a few select problematic assignments but is growing increasingly worried that her husband is becoming a problem in his own right. Will has found himself at the center of a dangerous web, completely in the dark, and he can’t figure out what’s going on until it’s nearly too late: his marriage threatened, his career in jeopardy, his life in peril.
