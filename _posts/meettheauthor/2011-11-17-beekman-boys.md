Josh Kilmer-Purcell and Dr. Brent Ridge, better known as The Beekman Boys and authors of The Beekman 1802 Heirloom Cookbook will be our featured speakers on Thursday, November 17 at 7 p.m.
“Heirlooms” of any type have a sentimental or intrinsic value greater than their assigned monetary figure. They are often irreplaceable, and because of this, they are treasured and passed down from one generation to the next.
With this in mind, best-selling Josh Kilmer-Purcell and Dr. Brent Ridge, also known as The Fabulous Beekman Boys set out to create The Beekman 1802 Heirloom Cookbook showcasing heirloom fruits and vegetables and recipes from their farm, family, and friends. Each recipe is simple and delicious, arranged by season, and intended for both every day and special occasions. From springtime pea pod risotto and summery strawberry shortcake to quick braised collards in autumn and yummy chicken ‘n’ dumplings for a snowy winter’s day, this is simple yet luscious farm-fresh fare that everyone will love.
