On Wednesday, August 29, 2018, we were visited by writing team Sue and James Patterson. 

Patterson fans young, old, and everywhere in between are invited to meet Sue and James Patterson, authors of the forthcoming picture book Cuddly Critters for Little Geniuses. Books will be available for purchase courtesy of Barrett Bookstore, including James' most recent thrillers, The President is Missing, and Texas Ranger.

About the Book
Axolotes, chinchillas, and sugar gliders–oh my!

In this charmingly illustrated follow-up to their first bestselling collaboration, Big Words for Little Geniuses, Susan and James Patterson create a collection of the world’s oddest and cutest animals that only little geniuses would know!

From sloths to spoonbills and panda ants to pangolins, little geniuses will love learning about all of the unusual, adorable animals that live on this planet. More than 50 little-known flyers, swimmers, and crawlers are included in this book, whimsically illustrated by artist Hsinping Pan. Cuddly Critters for Little Geniuses will remind you that nature contains many wonders–and these cute and curious creatures are no exception!

Doors will open a half hour before the event and seats are on a first come, first served basis. Can't make the live event? Check out the video recording at DarienLibrary.tv. Author photo courtesy of David Burnett.

About the Authors
Susan Solie Patterson has dreamed of writing and art directing a children's book since she received her Master of Fine Arts degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The bestselling Big Words for Little Geniuses was her first book with her husband, James Patterson.

James Patterson holds the Guinness World Record for the most #1 New York Times bestsellers, and his books have sold more than 375 million copies worldwide. In 2015, Patterson created a new children's book imprint, JIMMY Patterson, whose mission is simple: "We want every kid who finishes a JIMMY Book to say, 'PLEASE GIVE ME ANOTHER BOOK.'"
