On Thursday, July 19, 2012, author Alex Stone was our featured speaker.

Stone talked about his book, Fooling Houdini: Magicians, Mentalists, Math Geeks, and the Hidden Powers of the Mind. A blend of history, psychology, science, and memoir, Fooling Houdini is a funny, insightful account told from the author's unique perspective as a journalist and a former physics graduate student. A dedicated amateur magician since childhood, Stone vows to rebound from a disastrous showing at the 2006 Magic Olympics and soon embarks on an ambitious journey of self-improvement that takes him both across the globe and inside the brain, leading him to question life's biggest mysteries and investigate the fundamental aspects of human nature in the process.
