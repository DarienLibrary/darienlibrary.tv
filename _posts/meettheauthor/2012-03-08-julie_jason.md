On Thursday, March 8, 2012, Julie Jason, author of Managing Retirement Wealth, came to Darien Library. A real concern for investors approaching retirement is losing assets in volatile or down market periods, and as a result, having to either work longer or reduce lifestyles. Managing Retirement Wealth will help you anticipate market-moving events, graduate from random buying and selling, and construct a goal-directed personal portfolio customized to serve you and your family for a lifetime.
