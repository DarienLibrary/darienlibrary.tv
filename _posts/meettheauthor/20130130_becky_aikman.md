On Thursday, January 30, 2013, Becky Aikman, author of "Saturday Night Widows" was our featured speaker.

One night in 2010, Becky Aikman convened the first meeting of what she called the "Saturday Night Widows"â€”a group of six women (she among them) shocked to find themselves widowed in the middle of their lives. Becky's idea was to create an amateur support group to help one another not only past the toughest transition they'd ever made, but to reinvent themselves in the face of grief and build their lives anew.
