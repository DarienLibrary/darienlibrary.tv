On Thursday, June 21, 2012, Jenny Rosenstrach, author of Dinner: A Love Story was our featured speaker.
Jenny’s blog, Dinner: A Love Story, is where she shares her practical, laid-back advice on the family dinner ritual. The site, launched in March 2009, soon attracted tens of thousands of unique visits. Part cookbook, part memoir, Dinner: A Love Story provides a no-nonsense, non-judgmental approach to an issue that many parents struggle with—putting dinner on the table every night and trying to regain the benefits of the lost art of the family meal.
