Kris D'Agostino, author of The Sleepy Hollow Family Almanac was our featured speaker on Wednesday, March 21, 2012 at 7 p.m.

In the spirit of Nick Hornby and Tom Perrotta comes a smart, funny debut from novelist Kris D'Agostino about a disillusioned young man whose fledgling leap from post-adolescence to adulthood lands him back in an already overburdened family nest.
