On Wednesday, June 6, 2012, Nichole Bernier and her sister Carrie Bernier were our guests.

Nichole Bernier is the author of The Unfinished Works of Elizabeth D.
Kate Spenser is desperately in need of a vacation. Reeling from the death of her best friend Elizabeth a year prior, unnerved in the post-9/11 world, and struggling with her role as a stay-at-home mom and her deferred career ambitions, she longs for the safe haven of her family's summer rental on Great Rock Island. But Kate's baggage follows her to the island in the form of a trunk full of Elizabeth's private journals, a weighty inheritance that came with one instruction: Start at the beginning.
