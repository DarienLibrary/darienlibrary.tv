On Sunday, March 23, 2014, Matthew Berry, author of Fantasy Life, was our featured speaker. 

It's no secret that the fantasy sports business, especially the fantasy football business, is huge -- and growing exponentially. Every year over 30 million Americans play fantasy sports, which is more people than play golf, watch American Idol or visit the Grand Canyon. If fantasy was an actual sport, it would be the 4th most popular sport in the US. Celebrities play. Athletes play. Musicians play. Even President Obama's a fan. Fantasy sports, once a niche subculture, has become an all-consuming, beloved national pastime, and no one knows more about it than Matthew Berry.
