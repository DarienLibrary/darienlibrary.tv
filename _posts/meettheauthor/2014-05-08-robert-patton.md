On Thursday, May 8, 2014, Robert H. Patton, author of Hell Before Breakfast, was our featured speaker. 

From the acclaimed author of The Pattons and Patriot Pirates: a book that celebrates America's forgotten war correspondents, men who were legends in their time; who, between 1860 and 1910, between the Civil War and the Spanish-American War—when empires fell and dynasties flourished—led romantic, thrilling lives on the edgiest frontiers of time and place: seeing the world, breaking the stories, making news themselves during the time when newspapers made the most foreign of landscapes available, and the circulation wars were revolutionizing contemporary life, shaping global events, and making history.
