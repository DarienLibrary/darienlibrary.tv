On Sunday, December 8, 2013, bestselling author, Wally Lamb, visited Darien Library. 

With such New York Times bestsellers as She's Come Undone and The Hour I First Believed, Wally Lamb has won the hearts of millions of readers. We Are Water, Lamb's first full-scale novel in five years, is another probing exploration of contemporary themes, tempered with the wisdom and empathy that has marked all of this master storyteller's work. Rooted in the world of a troubled family and driven by riveting drama, this warm-hearted, emotionally powerful novel explores childhood trauma, abuse, and family dynamics, as well as issues of class, race, and cultural inclusion.
