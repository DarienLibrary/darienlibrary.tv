On Thursday, October 6, 2016, Darien Library and Darien Elementary School Parent Teacher Organizations of Hindley, Holmes, and Tokeneke invite you to hear from international speaker Kaitlin Roig-DeBellis. Kaitlin is the author of Choosing Hope.
Kaitlin’s story comes from her experience at the Sandy Hook Elementary School Massacre - she is the First Grade teacher who miraculously saved all of the 15 children in her classroom. Her story of ‘Choosing Hope’ is a real life demonstration of what it takes to be strong and resilient in life, no matter what your circumstance. She has made the choice to see the positive in the face of evil, to move forward despite life’s challenges, and to regain control.
Her story is motivational, informative and inspiring.
Kaitlin will be joined by Maud Purcell, Psychotherapist, and the Executive Director of the Life Solution Center of Darien. It was with the professional guidance and coaching from Maud that Kaitlin was able to harness her inner strength to move forward from the tragedy of December 14th, 2012. Kaitlin now travels all over the world sharing her message of hope and the power of choice. Kaitlin will be signing copies of her newly released paperback ‘Choosing Hope’ at the event.
