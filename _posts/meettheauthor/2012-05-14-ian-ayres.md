On Monday, May 14, 2012, Dr. Ian Ayres, co-founder of stickK.com gave a guest lecture at Darien Library. He discussed how best to craft incentives to stick to your goals. The new learning of behavioral economics and psychology teaches us that crafting effective incentives is a lot more than just setting the right price. Other people matter. Mindfulness matters. And framing matters.
