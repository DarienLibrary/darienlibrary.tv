On Monday, October 22, 2012, Emma Straub, author of Laura Lamont's Life in Pictures, was our featured speaker. 

Ambitious and richly imagined, this novel begins in 1929 and follows Elsa Emerson from her childhood in Door County, Wisconsin where her family owns the Cherry County Playhouse, to the glamour and excess of Hollywood, where she is remade into movie star Laura Lamont. Exploring the power of illusion and the possibility of escape, the expectations placed upon us by others and the identities we create for ourselves, Laura Lamont's Life in Pictures is a timeless story of a woman trying to balance career, family, and personal happiness, all while remaining true to herself
