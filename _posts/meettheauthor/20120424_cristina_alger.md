On Tuesday, April 24, 2012, Cristina Alger, author of The Darlings, was our featured speaker.

Bear Stearns, Fanny and Freddy, Lehman Brothers, and AIG have all collapsed. Hedge funds are closing in droves, and Howary LLP, the storied Wall Street law firm where Paul Ross has worked as an attorney for seven years, has imploded after the managing partner is indicted. When Paul loses his job, his father-in-law Carter Darling, billionaire financier, offers him the chance to head the legal team at his hedge fund. Thrilled with his good fortune in the midst of the worst financial downturn since the Great Depression, Paul accepts the position.
