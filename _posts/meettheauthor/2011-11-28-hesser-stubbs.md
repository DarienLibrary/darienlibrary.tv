Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs, authors of The Food52 Cookbook were our featured speakers on Monday, November 28, 2011 at 7 p.m.
Former New York Times food columnist and bestsellling author Amanda Hesser and her Food52.com co-founder Merrill Stubbs had a mission: to discover and celebrate the best home cooks in the country. Each week for 52 weeks, they ran recipe contests on their site, Food52.com, and the 140 winning recipes make up The Food52 Cookbook.
This first-ever online-community cookbook includes recipes like:
Double Chocolate Espresso Cookies
Secret Ingredient Beef Stew
Simple Summer Peach Cake
Wishbone Roast Chicken with Herb Butter
