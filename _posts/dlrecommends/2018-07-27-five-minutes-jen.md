Jen has selected four new books coming out this fall and winter. 

Daughter of a Daughter of a Queen by Sarah Bird at 0:35  "This is riveting. The writing is terrific, her voice is fantastic. It's awesome."

The Real Lolita by Sarah Weinman at 1:17 "It's probably going to make my top ten. It's such a fascinating true story. Everyone who has read this has just been riveted by it." 

I.M. by Isaac Mizrahi at 3:01 "I adored this. I devoured it in a day. His voice really shines through. It's like he's in the room with you. It's told with great love, it's a lot of fun."

Tin Man by Sarah Winman at 4:39 "Every reader who has read this has been profoundly affected by it and needs to talk to other people about it."
