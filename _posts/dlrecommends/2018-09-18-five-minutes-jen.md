We hosted our annual Book Buzz for Book Groups event where a whole slew of publisher reps come in to discuss the books they're most excited for in the coming season. Here are Jen's top five picks of those books presented. 

The Dakota Winters by Tom Barbash at 00:19:05 "It's the most perfect representation of a time in amber that I've read in a very long time. 

The World According to Fannie Davis by Bridgett M. Davis at 1:17 "It was the Jim Crow South, but in Detroit. It's a great look at a culture that I never knew that existed."

The Age of Light by Whitney Scharer at 2:08 "This is a wonderful, wonderful debut. You go down a rabbit hole with this book -- the likes which you can't imagine. I'm almost sad that I've already read it so I won't get to read it again for the first time." 

A Cloud in the Shape of a Girl by Jean Thompson at 3:04. "Three generations of Midwestern women living in a college town making the same mistakes, over, and over again. The writing is absolutely amazing." 

The Orphan of Salt Winds by Elizabeth Brooks at 4:12 "It's fun, it's awesome. It's for those of you who love English Gothics the way I love English Gothics. It's great for people who loved Atonement."
