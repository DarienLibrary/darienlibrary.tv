We're thinking about how to help your book group stay together over the holidays with these upbeat and very discussable short reads.

0:52 — Meet Me at the Museum by Anne Youngson. "Is an absolute favorite of ours. It's a book that deals with what life you can have after you've reached a certain age. Are there new and interesting things out there for you to do?" 


2:06 — News of the World by Paulette Jiles. "The author is a poet and this book does not have a single spare word. 

3:24 — The Uncommon Reader by Alan Bennett "is the one and only most popular book we've ever offered to book groups at this time of the year."

4:32 — Dear Mrs. Bird by AJ Pearce. "It's a great book because it talks about youth amongst world altering events.

5:43 — Born A Crime by Trevor Noah. "He comes through his circumstances with a sense of humor that is second to none. He is able to relate to people and their situations in life." 

Pat: "It's a bit of a love letter to his mother, a woman of remarkable spirit. She did not let apartheid grind her down or her hopes for her son."
 
7:02 — Calypso by David Sedaris. "It's a series of 22 different essays. I think this is his best book yet."

Marianne: "He walks a fine line between humor and tragedy.
