Meet Me at the Museum by Anne Youngson at 0:29 
Pat says, "It's a beautiful story. Beautifully told and has so much to discuss."

Brokeback Mountain by Annie Proulx at 1:32 
Marianne says, "Brokeback Mountain is considered her masterpiece short story. There's so many ways we can talk about human nature." 

Calypso by David Sedaris at 2:44 
Pat says, "He's funny as ever. This is a rumination on getting older. He's kinder. He's slightly softer. This may be my favorite collection of David Sedaris." 

Old Filth by Jane Gardam at 3:20 
Marianne says, "It's a popular book group read. It's a historic novel dealing with the tumultaneous times of the 20th century. It's a fascinating read. A wonderful, heartfelt story which you won't soon forget."

The Winter Soldier by Daniel Mason at 4:51
Pat says, "It's like watching a great 40's movie."
