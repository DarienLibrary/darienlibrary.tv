Jen made a field trip this week to present three books to the weekly Books by the Fire group. They meet on Wednesdays from 11 a.m. to 12 noon. The book group is informal and discusses what everyone is reading. If you'd like to join, come on Wednesdays and go to the First Floor fireplace.

To reserve any of these books for your book group, please use the "Request a Book in a Bag" button at darienlibrary.org/bookgroups
