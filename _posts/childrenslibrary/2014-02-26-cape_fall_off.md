Do you feel like your letting everyone down? Are you trying to live up to unrealistic expectations of what your life should be like? As caregivers, our days are filled with "must do's" and very little free time. All too often, we allow the media, society and even our friends and family to influence how we should live our lives, leaving us feeling guilty and inadequate when we simply don't have the time or energy to do so. Join motivational speaker and caregiver Alison Jacobson for insights on how to regain confidence, joy and live life on your terms!

Alison Jacobson is the mom of four children, step-mom to another four and care giver for a father with Alzheimer's, a husband with Multiple Sclerosis and a son with intellectual disabilities. Alison also understands personal tragedy. In 1997 she lost her first son to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

Her ability to reach people in a down-to-earth, uplifting and engaging manner while providing important information has made Alison a popular guest on many national television shows including The Today Show, Neal Cavuto, Fox & Friends and CNN as The Safety Mom.

This event was co-sponsored by Easter Seals Coastal Fairfield County.
