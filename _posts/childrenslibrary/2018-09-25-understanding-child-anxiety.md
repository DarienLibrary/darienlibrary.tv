On Tuesday, September 25, 2018, Darien SEPAC hosted a special talk for understanding anxiety in your child. 

Anxiety often goes hand in hand with learning disabilities and ADHD. This is a positive and empowering workshop for parents with students of all ages who have anxiety. Liz Driscoll Jorgensen and Dr. Mary Murphy will address the data behind what works and will teach basic skills parents can use to help soothe their child's anxiety. Together they will explain the unique presentations of anxiety in children with LD and ADHD; discuss the efficacy of non-medication interventions and focus on the positive "how to" set of skills parents can employ right away to help their child.

This event is co-sponsored by Darien SEPAC and Darien Library.
