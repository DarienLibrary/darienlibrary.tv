On Tuesday, January 15, 2013, the YWCA Parent Awareness Network and Darien Library presented an event by Children Online on online safety. 

With the rapid proliferation of iPods, iPhones and other personal media devices, children are online at younger ages than ever before. This new frontier is often challenging territory for elementary school children and their parents. Children Online, a comprehensive consulting company, provides up-to-date information about the use and impact of technology on child and adolescent development. Marje Monroe and Doug Fodeman have worked with thousands of students and parents since 1997 providing detailed information on the rapidly changing topic of children, teens and technology use. While gathering informative and instructive research on texting and online behavior of children and teens as well as publishing curriculum guides and a book for parents, Children Online has become a national leader in offering concrete and real-life strategies on this important topic.
