On Wednesday, March 13, 2012, Darien Library and YWCA Parent Awareness hosted a discussion about how touch screen technology and apps have changed the way even very young children interact with media, books and each other.

How much screentime is too much? Where do parents draw the line between healthy does of technology and oversaturation? How can parents find great, educational apps for different age groups? Hear from a panel of experts who will share their experiences and recommendations.

Panelists included Susan Gestal, LPC, a licensed play therapist in Greenwich, and Lisa Holton, the founder of kids' digital media producer, Fourth Story Media and vice-president of content development at Callaway Digital Arts.
