On Tuesday, October 23, 2018, we welcomed The Community Fund of Darien and the Thriving Youth Task Force to discuss the results of their January 2018 teen and parent survey.

This January, Darien 7-12th grade students responded to a survey asking about their sources of strength and support as well as their engagement with risky behaviors. Darien parents took a corresponding survey about their attitudes and perspectives regarding teen substance use. Join us to hear the results and learn from a panel of local experts!

The Darien Library is proud to cosponsor this event with The Community Fund of Darien and the Thriving Youth Task Force.
