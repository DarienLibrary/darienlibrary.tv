On Monday, April 27, 2015, William Henderson, Ed.D., author of The Blind Advantage: How Going Blind Made me a Stronger Principal and How Including Children with Disabilities Made the School Better for Everyone, presented practical strategies for developing successful inclusive schools.

Dr. Henderson discussed actions that individuals can take and policies that schools can develop to promote a culture of inclusion, to provide instruction with universal design and specialized supports, and to build a community that collaborates and problem solves. He also highlighted how including students with disabilities can be a catalyst for improving teaching and learning for everyone.

As a first-year teacher, Dr. Henderson learned he was gradually losing his vision and was advised he “should get out of education.” Instead he continued to persevere and went on to become principal of the Patrick O’Hearn Elementary School which is now renamed the Dr. William W. Henderson K- 12 Inclusion School.

This program was co-sponsored by SEPAC, the Special Education Parent Advisory Committee.
