On Thursday, September 20, 2012, learn the five things mom entrepreneurs have in common and hear from moms who are currently running their own ventures. Even if you don't want to start a business, you'll find this panel discussion fun and inspiring. Ideal for anyone who has questions about how to turn a hobby into a business or take a current venture to the next level, topics will include picking the right name, marketing, and using social media to build your brand.

Panelists include Stacey Bewkes of The Quintessence Blog, Jennifer St. Jean of the Itty Bitty Bag Company, Jennifer Covello from Fritabello Baby Journals, and two moms from RT Picture Works, Gwynne Tibbetts and Bambi Riegel. The panel moderator was Holly Hurd of VentureMom.com.
