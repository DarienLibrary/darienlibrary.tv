On Wednesday, May 9, 2018, Jennifer Laviano and Julie Swanson answered audience members' questions about special education rights. This video has been lightly edited to remove inaudible questions. 

Attorney Jennifer Laviano and special education advocate Julie Swanson will demystify the federal laws that govern the rights of children with disabilities and give you the information you need to help your child succeed in school and beyond. Topics will include: How to craft language in documents…criteria for independent evaluations…and deciphering IEP language. Plus, how the recent Supreme Court decision on Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District affects your child’s educational program.

Jennifer Laviano and Julie Swanson are co-authors of the new book, Your Special Education Rights. If you would like to purchase a copy and have it signed the night of the event, you may purchase a copy from Amazon. Books will not be sold at the event.

Important note from the presenters/authors: “Our sincere hope is that our candid account does not alienate educators and administrators, but rather raises awareness of how difficult it can be to navigate the special education system. Our goal is empowerment of parents so that they can work shoulder to shoulder with their school districts on behalf of their child, rather than against them.”

This event is co-sponsored by Darien SEPAC and Darien Library.
