On Thursday, February 27, 2014, we learned how to ace college interviews. 

A branding and marketing expert, Kyrie Stillman has spent her career launching and building brands and businesses. Preparing college applicants for admission incorporates her marketing acumen into the college arena. For the past 13 years Kyrie has interviewed hundreds of students as Co-Chair of a major metropolitan area Tufts University interview committee.

As Chairperson of a Tufts University interview committee for more 15 years, Peggy Marx has managed the interview process for hundreds of diverse applicants. A former Producer of business meetings, she trained high-level executives on how to be interviewed and how to speak from the podium--skills she readily applies to the college interview process.
