On Saturday, July 21, 2012, musician Dilly Dilly performed at Darien Library! The fictional band Level3, from the highly anticipated young adult novel Reunited by Hilary Weisman Graham, was unable to come to the Library! 

Reunited is about three ex-best friends who find out that their favorite rock band, Level3, is having a reunion show 2,000 miles away. The girls pile into a 1970's VM bus for a summer road trip they will never forget.
