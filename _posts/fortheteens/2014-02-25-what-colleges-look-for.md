On Tuesday, February 25, 2014, we had three speakers to the Library to discuss what college are looking for in students.

Demystify the high school curriculum planning process to reveal what colleges are really looking for. In this presentation, find out how important standardized tests and extracurricular activities really are.

Presented by Lee Gowen Marine and Lisa Nelson of Dunbar Educational Consultants and Lily Scheyhing, a tutor, teacher, and Program Director at Summit Educational Group.
