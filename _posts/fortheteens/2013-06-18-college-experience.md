On June 18, 2013, we hosted a panel presentation to learn from current college students and recent high school graduates about what college is really like.

The panel was moderated by Donald Kjelleren, Director of Middlebury College's Career Services Office and Lisa Nelson of Dunbar Educational Consultants in New Canaan, CT.
