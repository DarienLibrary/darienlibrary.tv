Learning differences do not need to stand in the way of a studentâ€™s pursuit of a college education. Increasingly, students with IEPs and 504 plans are participating in a range of programs that support students as they transition into and throughout college. Whether a student has ADHD, intellectual disabilities, autism, dyslexia, or other disability, post-secondary programs exist to prepare them for meaningful careers and independence.

About the Presenters:

Paul Ribeiro, Director of Guidance, Darien High School, will moderate a panel that will include representatives from a range of colleges. They will share details about available academic, social, and living supports. Panelists include:
